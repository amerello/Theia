I. What is this library?
------------------------

Theia is the goddess of sight and as such, this library aims to provide a swiss
army knife for computer vision tasks. Many algorithms and methods are
implemented in-house, and outside dependencies are limited and only used when
neccessary for performance or simplicity.

------------------------
II. How do I compile/install it?
------------------------

Theia depends on the following libraries:
Eigen: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/
Googletest: http://code.google.com/p/googletest/ (only if testing is enabled)

CMake is the build system used. From the base directory, execute the following
commands:

mkdir my_build
cd my_build
cmake ..
make

This should build the library with the proper configurations for you system. You
can also run the unittests by executing the command "make test" from the
my_build directory. You need to have google's gtest installed for the unittests.

If you inspect the CMake files in each directory, you'll notice I have a
particular strategy: every target is compiled as a static library. May not seem
like the wisest choice, but it's one that I've thought a lot about in terms of
making large amounts of code accessible, simple, and efficient to use and
develop. I have built macros in the base CMakeLists.txt file to help make
building the targest very simple. It also limits the cross dependencies between
various parts of the code, which makes it more efficient for unittests and other
applications.
