What is this library?
------------------------

Theia is the goddess of sight and as such, this library aims to provide a swiss
army knife for multi-view geometry tasks in computer vision. Many algorithms and
methods are implemented in-house, and outside dependencies are limited and only
used when neccessary for performance or simplicity. Additionally, we attempt to
make the interface for common algorithms (e.g., pose algorithms) as simple as
possible so that they can be easily used by any application.
