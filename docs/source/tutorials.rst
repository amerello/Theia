Tutorials
=========

We have written a set of tutorials to help get you started with using Theia. These tutorials do not represent the entire scope of the Theia library, but should still provide an example of the types of applications Theia empowers you to build.

**Tutorials are coming soon...**


We attempt to provide sufficient documentation in these tutorials but often further documentation can be found in the source code itself. Additionally, (nearly) every file is covered by a unit test that can be viewed as an example use case of the various methods and classes in Theia. If you have looked at the documentation, the source code, and the unit tests and still have confusion please email `the Theia mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/theia-vision-library>`_
