At the root of computer vision is a heavy amount of math and probability. Theia contains various math functions implemented with a generic interface for ease of use.

.. _section-closed_form_poly:

Closed Form Polynomial Solver
=============================

Many problems in vision rely on solving a polynomial quickly. For small degrees
(n <= 4) this can be done in closed form, making them exceptionally fast. We
have implemented solvers for these cases.

.. function:: int SolveQuadraticReals(double a, double b, double c, double* roots)

.. function:: int SolveQuadratic(double a, double b, double c, std::complex<double>* roots)

  Provides solutions to the equation :math:`a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0`

.. function::  int SolveCubicReals(double a, double b, double c, double d, double* roots)

.. function::  int SolveCubic(double a, double b, double c, double d, std::complex<double>* roots)

   Provides solutions to the equation :math:`a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d = 0` using `Cardano's <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_function#Cardano.27s_method>`_ method.


.. function::  int SolveQuarticReals(double a, double b, double c, double d, double e, double* roots)

.. function::  int SolveQuartic(double a, double b, double c, double d, double e, std::complex<double>* roots)

  Provides solutions to the equation :math:`a*x^4 + b*x^3 + c*x^2 + d*x + e = 0` using `Ferrari's method <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartic_function#Ferrari.27s_solution>`_ to reduce to problem to a depressed cubic.


.. _section-generic_poly:

Generic Polynomial Solver
=========================

For polynomials of degree > 4 there are no easy closed-form solutions, making
the problem of finding roots much more difficult. However, we have implemented
several functions that will solve for polynomial roots. For all polynomials we
require that the largest degree appears first and the smallest degree appears
last in the input VectorXd.

.. function:: bool FindPolynomialRoots(const Eigen::VectorXd& polynomial, Eigen::VectorXd* real, Eigen::VectorXd* imaginary)

  Roots are computed using the Companion Matrix with balancing to help improve
  the condition of the matrix system we solve. This is a reliable, stable method
  for computing roots but is most often the slowest method.

.. function:: bool FindRealPolynomialRoots(const Eigen::VectorXd& polynomial, Eigen::VectorXd* real)

  Using the Companion Matrix method above, we return only the real roots of the polynomial.


.. function:: bool FindRealPolynomialRootsSturm(const Eigen::VectorXd& coeffs, Eigen::VectorXd* real_roots)

  Real roots are bracketed within a boundary by analyzing Sturm sequences. Once
  a root has been isolated to a bound, an iterative solver is used to determine
  the actual root.

.. function:: bool FindRealPolynomialRootsJenkinsTraub(const Eigen::VectorXd& coeffs, Eigen::VectorXd* real_roots)

  The Jenkins-Traub method is a fast globally convergent iterative method for
  finding roots of polynomials with real coefficients. It was designed for
  machine precision and is robust to most polynomial types. One known case where
  is struggles is for sparse polynomials e.g., :math:`x^n + 1 = 0` where n is very
  large. This is the recommended method for iteratively computing polynomial
  roots.

.. function:: double FindRealRootIterative(const Eigen::VectorXd& polynomial, const double x0, const double epsilon, const int max_iter);

  Finds a single polynomials root iteratively based on the starting position :math:`x_0` and
  guaranteed precision of epsilon.

.. _section-gauss_jordan:

Guass-Jordan
============

.. function:: void GaussJordan(Eigen::MatrixBase<Derived>* input, int max_rows = 99999)

  Perform traditional Gauss-Jordan elimination on an Eigen3 matrix. If
  ``max_rows`` is specified, it will on perform Gauss-Jordan on the first
  ``max_rows`` number of rows. This is useful for problems where your system is
  extremely overdetermined and you do not need all rows to be solved.


.. _section-sprt:

Sequential Probability Ratio Test
=================================

Modified version of Wald's `SPRT <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_probability_ratio_test>`_ as [Matas]_ et. al. implement it in "Randomized
RANSAC with Sequential Probability Ratio Test"

.. function:: double CalculateSPRTDecisionThreshold(double sigma, double epsilon, double time_compute_model_ratio = 200.0, int num_models_verified = 1)

 ``sigma``: Probability of rejecting a good model (Bernoulli parameter).

 ``epsilon``: Inlier ratio.

 ``time_compute_model_ratio``: Computing the model parameters from a sample takes the same time as verification of time_compute_model_ratio data points. Matas et. al. use 200.

 ``num_model_verified``: Number of models that are verified per sample.

 ``Returns``:  The SPRT decision threshold based on the input parameters.


.. function:: bool SequentialProbabilityRatioTest(const std::vector<double>& residuals, double error_thresh, double sigma, double epsilon, double decision_threshold, int* num_tested_points, double* observed_inlier_ratio)

 Modified version of Wald's SPRT as [Matas]_ et. al. implement it in "Randomized
 RANSAC with Sequential Probability Ratio Test". See the paper for more
 details.

 ``residuals``: Error residuals to use for SPRT analysis.

 ``error_thresh``: Error threshold for determining when Datum fits the model.

 ``sigma``: Probability of rejecting a good model.

 ``epsilon``: Inlier ratio.

 ``decision_threshold``: The decision threshold at which to terminate.

 ``observed_inlier_ratio``: Output parameter of inlier ratio tested.
