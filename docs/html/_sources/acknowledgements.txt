Theia was originally developed to provide a centralized code base to the `Four Eyes Lab <http://ilab.cs.ucsb.edu>`_ at UC Santa Barbara, but has since been expanded to an open-source project for the vision community.

The core of the original library is written by `Chris Sweeney <http://cs.ucsb.edu/~cmsweeney>`_. Funding for Theia was provided by his advisors `Tobias Hollerer <http://cs.ucsb.edu/~holl>`_ and `Matthew Turk <http://cs.ucsb.edu/~mturk>`_.
